# üèéÔ∏è 03: Formula 1 Rear Wing Design (2023 Aero-Inspired)

## Project Overview

This is a personal CAD project focused on designing a modern Formula 1-inspired **rear wing assembly**, drawing structural and aerodynamic inspiration from the 2023 technical regulations. The model was designed using **Autodesk Fusion 360**. This project emphasizes advanced **surface modeling** and the creation of **multi-element airfoils** critical for generating downforce.

## Design Focus & Key Features

The design incorporates several key aerodynamic features found in contemporary F1 wings:

* **Multi-Element Airfoil:** Features a high-downforce **Main Plane** and **Upper Flap** to manage high-speed airflow and maximize downforce .
* **Curved Endplates:** Includes sculpted endplates crucial for managing **tip vortex** and limiting high-pressure air spillage from beneath the wing.
* **Pylon Integration:** Utilizes modern pylon placement to minimize disturbance to the suction side of the main plane.
* **Material:** Modeled using **CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer)**, reflecting real-world F1 construction for optimal strength-to-weight ratio.
